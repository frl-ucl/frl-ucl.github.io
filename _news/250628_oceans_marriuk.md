We’re proud to share that several of our students showcased their research at two major marine and ocean technology conferences this year — MarRI-UK 2025 in Liverpool, UK, and OCEANS 2025 in Brest, France. 🎤⚓

🔹 MarRI-UK 2025 – UK Marine Technology Postgraduate Conference
Held in Liverpool, this annual conference brings together the UK’s postgraduate marine research community. <br>
**Nana Kutin** presented his work on “Vessel Trajectory Classification from a Graph Network Perspective”, introducing a novel machine learning approach to understanding and predicting vessel behavior. <br>
**Yang Hu** took part in the Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) competition format, distilling complex research into a compelling, accessible pitch — an impressive demonstration of science communication in action! 

🔹 OCEANS 2025 – Brest, France
As one of the leading global events in marine technology and ocean science, OCEANS draws an international audience of researchers and industry professionals. <br>
**Sara Aldhaheri** presented on a [comparative study](https://frl-ucl.github.io/projects/underwater-robotic-simulators.html) for underwater robotic simulaors for autonomous system development.

We’re thrilled to see our students not only conducting innovative research but also actively engaging with the global marine tech community. Congratulations to all on representing your work — and our group — so strongly on the international stage! 🚀🌍
