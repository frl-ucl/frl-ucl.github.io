Weâ€™re excited to share that two of our recent research papers have been accepted to major international robotics conferences this year â€” IROS 2025 and RO-MAN 2025! ðŸ™Œ

ðŸ”¹ **IROS 2025 (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)**
This paper has a special story behind it â€” it began as an MSc individual project at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucl-computer-science/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BxXZe%2BERVRea0gIQGT1NNSQ%3D%3D) (AY 23/24). Seeing real promise in the initial idea, we continued the work as a 3rd-year undergraduate project in [UCL Mechanical Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucl-mechanical-engineering/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BxXZe%2BERVRea0gIQGT1NNSQ%3D%3D), brilliantly led by [Felix D](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-d-72a748169/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BxXZe%2BERVRea0gIQGT1NNSQ%3D%3D). We were also lucky to have Yanhong Huang join us as a visiting student, offering key co-supervision that helped elevate the project. A true cross-department, multi-level collaboration that evolved into a peer-reviewed IROS paper! ðŸ¤–ðŸ“„

ðŸ”¹ **RO-MAN 2025 (IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication)**
Our second paper by PhD students Yang Hu and Sara Aldhaheri focuses on Enhancing Human-Robot Trust and Collaboration in Unmanned Surface Vehicles through Fault Diagnosis. By improving fault diagnosis in USVs, weâ€™re advancing human-robot interaction in safety-critical, real-world environments â€” an important step for trustworthy autonomy on the water.

Huge congratulations and heartfelt thanks to everyone involved! Itâ€™s been incredible to see such meaningful collaboration across disciplines and stages of study turn into two impactful contributions to the field of robotics. ðŸš€ðŸ“š
