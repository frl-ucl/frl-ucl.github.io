Researchers at UCL are pioneering new all-weather autonomous navigation systems for marine robots and ships.

The breakthrough is thanks to cutting-edge radar technology provided by Navtech Radar. The project, supported by EPSRC and UCL Mechanical Engineering, aims to overcome one of the biggest challenges in maritime autonomy: operating reliably in any condition.

The work is being led by a team including researchers Yongchang Xie and Wenlong Gaozhang.
