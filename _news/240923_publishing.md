Yongchang Xie has his paper <b>Reliable LiDAR-based ship detection and tracking for Autonomous Surface Vehicles in busy maritime environments</b> published in Ocean Engineering. We have collected the first-ever real-world maritime LiDAR dataset for ship detection to accelerate the development of the autonomous maritime navigation field. The project is a collaboration between UCL MechEng, UCL CEGE and Port of London Authority, funded by EPSRC.
