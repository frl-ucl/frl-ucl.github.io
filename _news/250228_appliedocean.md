We are excited to share our latest publication, a collaboration between UCL Mechanical Engineering and Loughborough University, published in Applied Ocean Research!

🔬 Title: Adaptive Informative Path Planning for Active Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Water Pollution Dispersion Using Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs)

A huge congratulations to [Song Ma (马嵩)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ma-song/), our PhD student at UCL Mechanical Engineering, who led this work! 🎉👏 His dedication and expertise have been instrumental in driving this research forward.

We also extend our sincere thanks to our brilliant collaborators [Prof. Cunjia Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cunjia-liu-02a6529/) and Dr. Christopher M. Harvey from Loughborough University, whose valuable contributions have been essential to this work!

🌍 Why It Matters:
Pollution monitoring in marine environments is critical for ecological protection. Our research introduces an adaptive informative path planning (IPP) framework that enables USVs to autonomously track and reconstruct pollution dispersion—providing a powerful solution for monitoring oil spills, chemical leaks, and other environmental hazards.

⚙️ Key Innovations:
✅ Integration of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with recursive Bayesian estimation for real-time pollution tracking
✅ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based path planning for more efficient and accurate data collection
✅ Extensive evaluation in realistic scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over conventional methods
