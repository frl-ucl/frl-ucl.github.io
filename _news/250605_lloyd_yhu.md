Weâ€™re excited to officially launch our new MarRI-UK / Lloydâ€™s Register funded PhD project, focused on advancing the safety, transparency, and robustness of autonomous marine technologies

This project will develop a digital sandbox tool for marine autonomy systems â€” enabling full-system observability into complex decision-making processes across varying levels of autonomy. The aim is to support more reliable and explainable autonomy in the maritime domain. 

Weâ€™re thrilled to have Yang Hu as the PhD researcher leading this work, under the supervision of Dr. Peng Wu and myself at UCL Mechanical Engineering, with Joseph Morelos from Lloydâ€™s Register providing crucial industrial expertise. 

Special thanks to Giovanni Tenderini (Lloydâ€™s Register) and Wenjuan Wang (MarRI-UK) for their vision, support, and commitment in making this collaboration possible. 

We look forward to working closely with Lloydâ€™s Register and sharing our progress as the project unfolds â€” stay tuned!
