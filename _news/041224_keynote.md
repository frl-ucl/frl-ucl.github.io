Dr. Yuanchang Liu delivers a talk at [RiTA 2024 Conference](https://2024.icrita.org/invited-speakers/) on **Learning Enabled Marine Autonomy in Uncertain Marine Environments**.

**Abstract**: Autonomous marine robots have made rapid advancements in recent years, driven by exciting progress in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced sensory technologies, and robust decision-making systems. These robots are now being deployed in high-impact applications such as offshore wind farm inspections, search and rescue operations, and seabed mapping, among others. The key to achieving high-level autonomy in marine robots lies in the autonomous navigation system, which encompasses sensing/perception, planning/decision-making, and automatic control. This talk will focus on recent developments in advanced autonomy technologies for marine robots at UCL. Key topics include: 1) reliable semantic segmentation of the water surface, 2) efficient multi-constraint planning for surface vessels, 3) reinforcement learning-powered multi-task allocation, and 4) adversarial networks for enhanced maritime systems.
