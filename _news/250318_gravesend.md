🚢 Advancing Autonomy in Maritime: Multi-Mode Sensor Data Collection at Gravesend 🌊

Exciting progress in our research on multi-mode sensors for autonomous ships! 🎯 We recently conducted data collection trials aboard a Port of London Authority (PLA) survey boat at Gravesend. These trials are a crucial step in enhancing autonomous vessel perception and navigation.

Autonomous marine navigation has made significant strides, but harsh weather conditions still pose a major challenge. To bridge this gap, we are exploring the potential of 360° high-definition imaging radar to enable all-weather autonomous navigation for marine vessels.

By leveraging advanced radar imaging, we aim to enhance situational awareness, obstacle detection, and decision-making capabilities—even in fog, heavy rain, and rough seas. This breakthrough could pave the way for safer, more reliable autonomous operations across commercial shipping, offshore industries.⚓️🚀

A huge thank you to [Port of London Authority](https://www.linkedin.com/company/port-of-london-authority/) for their support, as well as [EPSRC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epsrc/) for funding this important research. We also extend our gratitude to [UCL Mechanical Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucl-mechanical-engineering/) for their invaluable support. Most importantly, a massive shoutout to our dedicated team whose expertise and hard work made this possible! 💪
