We’ve successfully delivered the first workshop for our Clean Maritime Project funded by the [MarRI-UK core research programme](https://marri-uk.org/index.php/project-funded/members-research-programme/). The workshop was well attended by leading maritime industries (BMT Group, Lloyds’ Register, BAE Systems, Oasis Marine, ECOMAR propulsion, etc.) and major marine/maritime universities (University of Strathclyde, University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moore University, etc.).
