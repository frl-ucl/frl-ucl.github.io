We had an incredible day out at Richmond Lock, running a series of field tests with two UCL-developed marine robots.

This was more than just a technical milestone. It was a powerful reminder of how much public curiosity and enthusiasm exists around science and technology. As we navigated the robotic boats through the water, passers-by stopped to watch, ask questions, and share their thoughts — from water quality to river safety, it was clear that our research resonated with real community interests.

The field trial was made possible through the amazing support from UCL Mechanical Engineering, the Port of London Authority, and EPSRC. Huge thanks to all involved for enabling this work and making real-world testing a reality. 

These moments in the field show us what engineering is truly about: connecting cutting-edge research with real-world impact. This is the heart of our mission at UCL Engineering — to Change the World. 🌐🛠️
