Weâ€™re excited to see our ALADDIN demonstrator project featured in this month's [Lloyd's Register Foundation newsletter](https://www.lrfoundation.org.uk/news/centre-for-assuring-autonomy-cfaa-publishes-demonstrator-project-review). Alongside 26 other projects, we have contributed to the final [Demonstrator Project Review](https://www.flipsnack.com/assuringautonomy/aaip-demonstrator-review/full-view.html) (p. 12-13). 

Our work has advanced the knowledge base for assuring next-generation maritime autonomous systems in harsh environments. We are deeply grateful to our funder, the [Centre for Assuring Autonomy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/assuring-autonomy/), and our collaborators from the [National Oceanography Centre](https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-oceanography-centre/) (**Catherine Harris**, **Izzat Kamarudzaman**, **Alvaro Lorenzo Lopez**, **Georgios Salavasidis**). Special thanks also go to **Enrico Anderlini**, **Peng Wu**, and [UCL Mechanical Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucl-mechanical-engineering/).
