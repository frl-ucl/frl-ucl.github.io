UCL's Marine Research Group has secured over £1 million in UK government funding as a key partner in two winning Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition projects.

The group will lead work on a major initiative, 'Tugbeam,' focused on developing digital twin technology, predictive maintenance, and control systems for new electric tugboats. The project is a collaboration with the Port of Shetland and industry experts to advance maritime decarbonisation and digitalisation.
