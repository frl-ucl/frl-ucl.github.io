In collaboration with Port of London Authority, our research group conducted a series of data collection trials on the River Thames. We used multiple perception sensors including 3D LiDAR, high-resolution cameras, sound velocity profilers, etc. onboard a survey vessel to achieve a comprehensive autonomous understanding of traffic in busy waterways. We are grateful for the support from Port of London Authority and our funder, EPSRC.
