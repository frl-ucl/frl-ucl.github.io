Our group is dedicated to advancing autonomous systems across field research in three core areas: <b>Reliable Sensing and Perception</b>, <b>Intelligent Planning and Decision Making</b>, and <b>Advanced Robust Control</b>. Our mission is to develop resilient technologies that enhance system reliability by integrating sophisticated sensing, perception, and adaptive control frameworks. By leveraging the latest advances in machine learning, optimization, and control theory, we address real-world challenges, enabling autonomous platforms to navigate and operate effectively in complex, dynamic environments.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
